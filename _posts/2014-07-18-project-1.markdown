description: <p style="color:white;"> I am a Colombian particle physicist. I did my BSc. and my MSc. in one of the top Colombian universities - Universidad de Antioquia. For my undergrad, I worked in theoretical physics. Specifically, my thesis was a review of path integrals in curved space-time - which included an application to the Sagnac effect.</p><p style="color:white;">In 2017, I started to work with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. There, I learnt the basics about high-energy physics. My dissertation was about a feasibility study for the HL-LHC and a trigger proposal for a dark matter search.</p><p style="color:white;">In the very recent past, I held a Sciences and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) scholarship for my Ph.D. I studied at the University of Manchester, working with the ATLAS experiment. My research is focused on physical processes where tau leptons are produced in the final states. If you want to know more, go to my work project tab! During this time I also joined Electronic Arts, a videogames company, where I completed a six month internship. At EA I developed a simulation of plasticity and destruction, and also documented and created a lot of example code for game creators to learn how to use the physics engine. Now it's time to leave physics aside...</p><p style="color:white;"> In my free time, I love cooking. I consider myself a good cook. I am very social, I love to talk with my people while I make food for them! </p><figure><img src='img/portfolio/ceviche.jpg' alt='missing' /><figcaption>My favourite food is ceviche, made by me!</figcaption></figure><p style="color:white;"> I am really passionate about technology, I can spend hours watching tech-related videos! Recently, I got very interested into software development for industry applications. In consequence, I have started to learn about some non-physics related tools and I will link more of these projects in this webpage!</p><figure><img src='img/portfolio/sanandres.jpg' alt='missing' /><figcaption>Me and my partner in a beautiful, Colombian island called San Andres</figcaption>
