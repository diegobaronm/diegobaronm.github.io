description: <p style="color:white;"> I am a Colombian particle physicist. I did my bachelor's and my master's degree in one of the best Colombian universities, Universidad de Antioquia. For my undergraduate, I worked in theoretical physics, specifically, my thesis was about path integrals in curved space-time.</p><p style="color:white;">In 2017, for my master's project, I started to work with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. There, I learnt the basics about high-energy physics. My dissertation was about a feasibility study and the trigger for a dark matter search.</p><p style="color:white;">Currently, I hold a Sciences and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) scholarship for my Ph.D. I am studying at the University of Manchester, working with the ATLAS experiment. My research is focused on physical processes where tau leptons are produced in the final states. If you want to know more, go to my Ph.D. project tab! Now it's time to leave physics aside...</p><p style="color:white;"> In my free time, I love cooking. I consider myself a good cook. I am very social, I love to talk with my people while I make food for them! </p><figure><img src='img/portfolio/ceviche.jpg' alt='missing' /><figcaption>My favourite food, ceviche, made by me!</figcaption></figure><p style="color:white;"> I am really passionate about technology, I can spend hours watching tech-related videos! Recently, I got very interested into software development for industry applications. In consequence, I have started to learn about some non-physics related tools and I will link more of these projects in this webpage!</p><figure><img src='img/portfolio/sanandres.jpg' alt='missing' /><figcaption>Me in a beautiful, Colombian Island, San Andres!</figcaption>
