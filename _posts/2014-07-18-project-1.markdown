description: I am a Colombian particle physicist. I did my bachelor's and my master's degree in one of the best Colombian universities, Universidad de Antioquia. For my undergraduate, I worked in theoretical physics, specifically, my thesis was about path integrals in curved space-time.

In 2017, for my master's project, I started to work with the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment. Here I learned the basics of high-energy physics. My dissertation was about a feasibility study and the trigger for dark matter search.

Currently, I hold a Sciences and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) scholarship for my Ph.D. I am studying at the University of Manchester, working with the ATLAS experiment. My research is now focused on physical processes where tau leptons are produced in the final states. If you want to know more, go to my Ph.D. project tab! Now time to leave physics aside...
