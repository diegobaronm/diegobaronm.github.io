description: This code is used for analysing the data and simulation from the ATLAS experiment. It does many things such as producing histograms, re-weighting of kinematic distributions, calculating data-driven backgrounds, performing fits, producing plots, submitting jobs to a condor server and much more. It is just here to show an example of the code that I write when I want to do analysis.
