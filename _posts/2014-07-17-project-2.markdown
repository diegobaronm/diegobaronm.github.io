description: <p style="color:white;"> My research is in the field of experimental high energy physics. First, my review for experts. You can skip the next paragraph if you are not familiar with physics but you can come back to it later.</p><p style="color:white;"> I am currently working in the ATLAS collaboration, measuring the performance of the tau identification algorithm. I will derive the corresponding scale factors to correct the Monte Carlo simulations to resemble what is observed in real data. My research is motivated by the independence of this measurement from lepton universality violation effects, because we are using Z boson decays to pairs of tau leptons to measure the scale factors. The other part of my PhD will be dedicated to a standard model precision measurement. We will try to observe VBF Z production in tau-tau final states. Our final goal is to use this measurement as a probe for beyond standard model physics.</p> <p style="color:white;"> Let's start by clarigying what is the field of experimental high energy physics (HEP). At school, we were all told that matter is made of fundamental pieces called atoms. Unfortunately (fortunately for physicists I would say), this is not the whole story. Atoms have a nucleus formed of protons and neutrons, sorrounded by a cloud of electrons. But, since the 1930's physycists have discovered more particles apart from the proton, the neutron and the electron. Now, we even know that protons and neutrons are composed of other fundamental particles called quarks and gluons!</p> <p style="color:white;"> Scientists have embarked theirself into the enterprise of discovering new particles, measuring their properties and stablishing the set of laws and relations between the fundamental pieces of our universe. This is what we call HEP.</p><p style="color:white;">Now, let's explain, why experimental HEP? In raw terms, the field of HEP is split in two big branches. First, theoretical physicists, the guys in charge of proposing the models(theories), predicting the values for physical quantities (like the mass of the particles or the electric charge) and modelling the phenomena that particles undergo when they interact with detectors. Complementary to this big effort, we have experimental physicists, the branch that I belong to. We build the detectors, we study the interaction between the particles and the machines and we take, calibrate and analyze the data produced by them.</p><p style="color:white;"> At the moment, we know that there exist 63 fundamental particles, we don't have time to talk about all of them here! Therefore, I will focus on the most important ones from the point of view of my research. These days, our understanding of elementary particles is described by the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This is the common framework of HEP and the most explicative and predictive physics theory we have. Phenomena like the interaction of electrons with light and atomic radioactivity are explained in the SM.</p> <p style="color:white;"> The SM states that every particle that is electrically charged, like the electron or the proton, interacts with light. This is what we call electromagnetic interactions. Light itself can be described as being composed of particles which are called photons.<figure><img src='img/portfolio/egammap.png' alt='missing' /><figcaption>In atoms, the electric interaction between protons in the nucleous and electrons around, can be undertand as if the charged particles were exchanging photons (ligth particles).</figcaption></figure></p> <p style="color:white;"> Radioactivity in atoms, which weak forces are responsible for, can be explained by the exchange of other particles named the W and Z bosons. But not only electrons are involved in weak and electromagnetic interactions.</p> <p style="color:white;"> Electrons have bigger brothers! They are called the muon and the tau. The muon is 200 times more masssive than the electron and the tau is 3500 times more massive! Myy research is about tau particles!!! <figure><img  src="img/leptons.png" alt='missing' /><figcaption>In the SM the only difference between taus, muons and electrons is their mass.</figcaption></figure></p> <p style="color:white;"> In part because of their mass, taus are short-lived particles and they can decay into lighter particles like the muon or the electron.  This is the way we actually "see" taus in our detectors, we infere that they were there because we can see their decay products. </p> <p style="color:white;"> I work with the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) detector. This is a BIG particle detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the biggest and most energetic particle accelerator on earth! <figure><img  src="img/portfolio/MeAndATLAS.jpg" alt='missing' /><figcaption>Me, inside the ATLAS cavern! The detector is approximately 30m long and is as tall as a 9 storeys building!</figcaption></figure></p><p style="color:white;"> In the ATLAS collaboration, physicists have developed deep neural networks algorithms which can help to identify tau particles. These algorithms have been trained on simulations and my research is about measuring the performace of this algorithms in the real data from the collisions. Finally, I will derive scale factors to correct the simulation for it to resemble the real data. As my other project for the PhD, I will try to look for new physics beyond the SM, using taus.</p>
