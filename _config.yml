description: I am a young particle physicist. I am now doing my PhD at the University of Manchester, analyzing/calibrating data for the ATLAS collaboration. Additionally, I have computing experience in C++, Python, Git and Linux. I have as well some experience with data science (non physics-related). In this page, your can checkut my projects and get to know me a bit. Have fun!
